ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Irfan! I am currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at The University of Edinburgh. I'm passionate about developing innovative AI solutions and am particularly interested in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I love collaborating on open source projects and am eager to connect with other AI enthusiasts and developers. Feel free to check out my repositories and reach out if you're interested in working together or exchanging ideas!

Iâ€™m interested in exploring diverse AI fields such as NLP, computer vision, probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).

Iâ€™m currently learning about Probabilistic Circuits (PCs), diving deep into how they can enhance machine learning models by providing a more structured probabilistic framework.
